# Project Title
This class project's purpose was to build a single-linked list with the use of templates while handling memory management. This was to teach us about linked lists. The professors provided the test files, LinkedListInterface.h, main.cpp, and check.sh. I wrote the code for LinkedList.h

## Running the tests
With all the files downloaded and in the correct directory, ./LinkedList will run the code. ./check.sh will compare the output files with the key files.

### Part 1 - Insertion Tests
* Construct a Single-Linked List that can be used with template classes and that passes all of the Test Driver's insertion tests consisting of file1.txt and file2.txt
* These will test the insertHead, insertTail, and insertAfter functions.

### Part 2 - Remove
* This will test the remove and clear functions. Includes files file3.txt and file4.txt.

### Part 3 - Comprehensive Test
* Pass file5.txt of the Test Driver. This more comprehensively tests all the linked list's functions using strings.

### Part 4 - No Leaks in the Hull
* Run and pass Valgrind on the program to ensure that there are no memory leaks.
